The Prometheus Operator provides [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) native deployment and management of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and related monitoring components.
The purpose of this project is to simplify and automate the configuration of a Prometheus based monitoring stack for Kubernetes clusters.

The Prometheus operator includes, but is not limited to, the following features:

* Kubernetes Custom Resources: Use Kubernetes custom resources to deploy and manage Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related components.
* Simplified Deployment Configuration: Configure the fundamentals of Prometheus like versions, persistence, retention policies, and replicas from a native Kubernetes resource.
* Prometheus Target Configuration: Automatically generate monitoring target configurations based on familiar Kubernetes label queries; no need to learn a Prometheus specific configuration language.
